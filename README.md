# Pytools-Lithography

## Introduction

This Jupyter Notebook was crafted as part of my Minor in Microtecnology, Processing and Devices (MPD) at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. While drawing inspiration from the work of previous students (Niek van Koolwijk and Lucas Sluitman), and the cross-platform compatibility updates by Emma Bajmat the code is further updated to use existing image analysis functions.

To enhance clarity, I've organized the code into multiple Python scripts, prioritizing a clear and comprehensive depiction of the processes. While it may not strictly adhere to conventional principles of good code, I believe that in this context, prioritizing clarity is favourable.

## Gotchas
- Make it easy on yourself and keep one path for all your analyses ... otherwise you will get a different path everywhere and suddenly you are editing three different images.
